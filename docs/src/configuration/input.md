# `input` section

- [`input.keyboard` section](#inputkeyboard)
- [`input.mouse` section](#inputmouse)
- [`input.per-device` section](#inputper-device)

## `input.keyboard`

- `input.keyboard.rules`, `input.keyboard.model`, `input.keyboard.layout`, `input.keyboard.variant`, `input.keyboard.options`

These are all XKB-compliant configuration options for your keyboard. These get applied globally to the `wl_seat` instance, so there's no way to configure them on a per-device basis.

Read `man 7 xkeyboard-config` man page to get valid values and formatting for these fields.

`input.keyboard.layout` defaults to `us`

---

- `input.keyboard.repeat-delay`

Delay in milliseconds since key down until repeating starts.

Defaults to `250`

---

- `input.keyboard.repeat-rate`

The rate of repeating keys in characters per second.

Defaults to `25`

## `input.mouse`

> **NOTE**: Not specifying any of these fields will make the compositor use the device's default for the setting, if any exists.

- `input.mouse.acceleration-profile`

The profile that decides the general method of pointer acceleration

| Value     | Description                                                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flat`    | Pointer motion is accelerated by a constant (device-specific) factor, depending on the current speed. |
| `adaptive`| Pointer acceleration depends on the input speed. This is the default profile for most devices.        |

Refer to <https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/pointer-acceleration.html#pointer-acceleration> for more information.

---

- `input.mouse.acceleration-speed`

The speed that the mouse pointer accelerates with. Must be clamped between `[-1, 1]`

Refer to <https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/pointer-acceleration.html#pointer-acceleration> for more information.

---

- `input.mouse.left-handed`

Whether to enable left handed mode on the mouse. This generally swaps the left and right buttons.

---

- `input.mouse.scroll-method`

How should the scrolling method on the touchpad be

| Value           | Description                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `no-scroll`     | Never send scroll events instead of pointer motion events. This has no effect on events generated by scroll wheels.|
| `two-finger`    | Send scroll events when two fingers are logically down on the device.                                              |
| `edge`          | Send scroll events when two fingers are logically down on the device.                                              |
| `on-button-down`| Send scroll events when a button is down and the device moves along a scroll-capable axis.                         |

Refer to <https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/scrolling.html#scrolling> for more information.

---

- `input.mouse.scroll-button-lock`

Should the mouse scroll button (`input.mouse.scroll-button`) be pressed one to toggle the scroll mode, instead of needing to be pressed in order to enable it

Refer to <https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/scrolling.html#scrolling> for more information.

---

- `input.mouse.scroll-button`

If the value is `false` the button must physically be held down for button scrolling to work. If the value is `true`, the button is considered logically down after the first press and release sequence, and logically up after the second press and release sequence.

This is only effective if `input.mouse.scroll-method` is `on-button-down`

Valid mouse buttons are: `left`, `right`, `middle`, `forward`, `back`

---

- `input.mouse.click-method`

The button click method defines when to generate software-emulated buttons, usually on a device that does not have a specific physical button available.

| Value          | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `button-areas` | Use software-button areas (see [click-finger behavior here](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/clickpad_softbuttons.html#clickfinger)) to generate button events.|
| `click-finger` | the number of fingers decides which button press to generate. |
